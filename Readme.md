# Setting Up Python on macOS

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to installing Python on a Mac, ensuring a clean and manageable environment.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS**: Ensure your system is up-to-date.
- **Terminal Access**: Familiarity with the Terminal application.

## Steps

### 1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

This command installs essential developer tools required for building and compiling software on macOS.

### 2. Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software.

In Terminal, execute:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
  
After installation, ensure Homebrew is in your system's PATH.

### 3. Install Pyenv

Pyenv allows you to manage multiple Python versions on your system.

Run:

```bash
brew install pyenv
```

After installation, add Pyenv to your shell's initialization file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then, reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 4. Install Desired Python Version

With Pyenv set up, you can install the Python version of your choice.

For example, to install Python 3.9.1:

```bash
pyenv install 3.9.1
```

Set this version as the global default:

```bash
pyenv global 3.9.1
```

### 5. Verify Installation

Confirm that the correct Python version is active:

```bash
python --version
```

This should display `Python 3.9.1` (or the version you installed).

### 6. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

It's good practice to use virtual environments for project-specific dependencies.

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

To deactivate, simply run:

```bash
deactivate
```

By following these steps, you'll have a robust Python environment on your Mac, allowing for efficient development and management of Python projects.
